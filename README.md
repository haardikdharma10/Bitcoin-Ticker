# Bitcoin-Ticker ðŸ¤‘

## Goal

The objective of this project is to learn about using Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform.

## Abstract

Weâ€™re going to make a crypto currency price checking app. By the end of the module, we'll be able to monitor bitcoin investments on the move!

## What I learned from this project:

- How to use the DropdownButton Widget from Material design.
- How to loop through code using Dart for and for-in loops.
- How to use Cupertino Widgets in your app.
- How to check the platform your app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.
- Revised previous concepts by completing the challenges.
